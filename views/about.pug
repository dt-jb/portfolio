            I'm burgeoning developer following my curiosity, passion for learning, and love of all things tech to a new career in web development.
            With a previous career as a sales engineer and mechanical engineering background, I believe I bring a unique perspective to the web development universe.
            As a newcomer to the industry I'm eager to meet new people, learn new things, and apply my technical acumen to help build something great!
