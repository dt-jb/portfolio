Hello, I hope you enjoy my portfolio site.  
I am attempting to achieve an exceeds expectations mark on this project.

In order to satisfy the css exceeds expectations requirements I made the following changes:
  -Changed background color of both the sidebar, main article.
  -Changed the color of the font on all of the side bar text, including the link hover state.
  -Changed the font to more suit my style.

Please don't hesitate to provide feedback regarding style choices, website content, etc.

Thank you!
